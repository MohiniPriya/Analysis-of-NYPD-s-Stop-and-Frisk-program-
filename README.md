# Analysis-of-NYPD-s-Stop-and-Frisk-program-
 Goal: To check the overall effectiveness of Stop and Frisk program commissioned by the New York Police Department (NYPD) in terms of 
 curbing crime rate in New York city and to identify if there was any evidence of racial bias in this program.
"Stop, question and frisk" is an NYPD policy wherein police will detain and question pedestrians, and potentially search them, if they 
have a reasonable suspicion that the individual is armed, engaged, or about to be engaged, in criminal conduct. 
In particular, following questions were answered through analysis using Python
